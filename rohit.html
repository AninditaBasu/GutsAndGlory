Would you please "EDI"????
</p>

<p>
How's the job of a technical writer like? Do you guys ever have fun? Like really?
</p>

<p>Well yeah, you're right. Loads and loads of fun - particularly so when you're an editor. Now, we all have to agree that a technical writing editor in a team is perhaps the most annoying - what with all those red marks coming your way? It's especially annoying when a sentence you've written with your heart and soul, and sometimes not with so much heart and soul, is mutilated, distorted, given a tummy tuck, and released as 'suitably enhanced. - Editor.'</p>

<p>Let's start with a wonderful resume that came our way recently. The application was for the post of a technical writer, but of course! Duh! A colleague was fascinated by the nature of the resume. The person is concern had nearly two decades of experience! What?? The resume was hugely detailed. The person was very active physically. The person loved to socialize (thank you?). The person loved bartending at friends'. The person was a social activist (hmm..). "Very interesting" We said out loud. "But, why is there nothing about all that experience in technical writing?" Okay, let's give this case a rest. We didn't get the bartender on board. The textual experience in the resume left us delirious, and positively drunk.</p>

<p>Confusing readers is an easy job. Ain't it? And boy is it fun! Sometimes in technical writing, you hate to leave the readers wondering. It's hard, you see. Completeness of information is an absolute must. The three Cs - Clarity, consistency, conciseness - have to be kept in mind at all times. You agree? Of course you do. I came across a handiwork of perfect completion recently. I'll put it in dialog format:</p>

<div class = "w3-container">
<div class = "w3-container"><div class = "w3-card-4">
<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>A great dialogue</h4></header>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Technical Writer (TW): The license key appears, by default.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Technical Writer's Heart (TWH): This field can be edited. What if the user edits this? No, he won't! Yeah, but he has to be informed.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW: Do not edit the license key. It is captured from the version of the product installed in your system.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TWH: But do I have to tell him this?  Too much info? No no, but you have to avoid confusion. Let me add a note.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW: Note: The license key field can be altered. However, if you alter the license key, an error message is displayed.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TWH: Ah, now it's complete. Ready for edit! Woohoo!</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We do really have some great souls like these - with the intentions of pure good.  Any evil editor will reject this piece of good intention.</p>

<div class = "w3-container">
<div class = "w3-container"><div class = "w3-card-4">
<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Cartoon</h4></header>
<p>Space for cartoon</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is not uncommon for an editor to be called for meetings where the theme, design, the overall look of an application is discussed. Those are places where you can really tell what a person is going to ten years down the line, or perhaps as a grandfather.</p>

<div class = "w3-container">
<div class = "w3-container"><div class = "w3-card-4">
<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Another great dialogue</h4></header>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW1: I like the pink and blue combo for the tool bar. Can you make the font white?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Designer (Hiding his shock): Sure, I'll show you how that looks.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Editor(looking at the designer, mouthing): Are you serious?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW1: Not so good right. Try Grey and red. Yeah, correct. Hmm..change the colour of the font. Choose something yourself. Something yellowish maybe. Or white?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Designer(wondering): Are we designing for Disneyland?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW2: Hey, hold on, Grey, red looks fine. Just make the font black. It'll look great.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Editor: Yeah, that looks better.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW1: Grey, red see I told you! Font color doesn't matter./p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">TW2: Of course, it does.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Editor: Okay, red and grey it is.</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poor designer then applies the colors. What transpires in bloodier than the Battle of Plassey. The revolting appearance of the UI has him in tears. He then secretly decides to do some homework, and work on the appearance himself.</p>

<div class = "w3-container">
<div class = "w3-container"><div class = "w3-card-4">
<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Cartoon</h4></header>

<p>And now for those insufferable homonyms - a matter of concern for many a colleague of ours.  Homonyms are not a blessing, I repeat, homonyms are not a blessing. Except, (expect - such a weed), accept, quiet, quite (not quite), effect, affect - need I mention more? Wait, can I? I believe these errors are as a result of quickness of thought - or at least let me hope so. So it is common to find mistakes such as 'Except the screen' or 'Except and save.'</p>

<p>Some of our colleagues believe in the principle of 'I repeat' 'I repeat'. I repeat, some of our colleagues believe in the principle of 'I repeat'.  Take for example, 'In the Name field, enter Name' or 'In the Enter the PINCODE field, enter the pincode.' or 'Press View Bank Reconciliation Screen' button to view the Bank Reconciliation screen. Okay. You're right, that chair you saw flying across the skies this morning has indeed landed on head of one of us!</p>

<div class = "w3-container"><div class = "w3-card-4">
<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Cartoon</h4></header>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>And finally the insanity that comes in the form of mails. I recently received communication about a shared folder. The message was that the system was triggering a mail whenever the folder was downloaded. No, that is not where it ends. They convinced me that they were 'working out' to resolve the issue. Okay, if you say so! I suppose it is important to build those muscles to resolve these 'weighty' issues. And then the constant flow of mails that request me to 'edi' their documents. Sure sir, can you gift me a 'T' in return?</p>

<p>Editing sure is fun. It important however, to maintain a level of sanity, lest you want to pull at your hair, and run out screaming into the night, or pop a million pills, and burp toxic gases into the air.  It is also important to ideate with your editor and make life easier for both of us. It is a good idea to keep a tab on your own writing, watch out on the number of review comments, the nature of review comments, observe a pattern, and work on your skills.</p>

<p>And then an editor will accept your work - with pleasure. Oh wait, or is it except?</p>
