        <h2>Udaan</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">        
		<p>Udaan (उड़ान) is a Hindi word that means flight.</p>
		<p>Michi, the conference mascot, inspired this name. You don't know about Michi? Read on, then, for her story.</p>
		<div class="w3-container w3-sand w3-text-black-opacity w3-border">
		<p>Michi was a lonely little bird. She was new to the garden, didn't know anyone, didn't have any friends. Other birds were nice to her. They would let her be. No one talked to her and made her uncomfortable. No one really took notice of her. No one bothered her. They were indeed nice to her.</p>
		<p>On particularly bright and sunny days, all birds would come out and play. They would play a game of flying high.. making circles and shapes in the air.. cutting each others' flight.. laughing at each other.. laughing with each other. They would spread their wings.. someone's orange, someone's blue, someone's red, someone's purple.. The sky would look alive and vibrant with all those splashes of beautiful colours. Oh, it was so much fun. It would be difficult to contain all that joy in those tiny hearts. All the birds would break into songs. Beautiful melodies would fill the air. The world would become a melodious little place. When everyone is enjoying what they do, it's an obvious thing to happen, is it not? The world turns into an enchanted paradise.</p>
		<p>But, no, not for Michi... Michi would sit alone on a branch of a tree in the corner, waiting for her turn to fly. Waiting for someone to invite her to play. She would wait patiently. But nobody invited her. Nobody noticed her. How could they? She didn't have any vibrant colours on her feathers. She wasn't colourful like others were. She was a pale grey. Dull and boring. She didn't have a melodious voice. Her whistle was neither singsong nor loud. It was just there. Just like her. Existed, that's all.</p>
		<p>Her wings were not strong either. She just couldn't reach the heights that others so effortlessly conquered. Living in shadows seemed simpler to little Michi. She never complained of these. She thought she was alright. But at times, she would feel very lonely and a little sad..for she had not yet found a song. A song of her own.</p>
		<p>The days passed by. Someone was watching all this from a great distance. Without a word. It was the sky. It kept watching Michi in silence. For days after days. For seasons after seasons.</p>
		<p>Waiting for her turn soon became a way of life for Michi. She would get bored with waiting. She would sit on the same branch of the same tree every day. She would wait sincerely and silently for her turn. She would keep watching others, and wondering how it felt to be like them. What else was she to do? She didn't have any options.</p>
		<p>And then one day. One day, she noticed a flower bloom in a corner of the garden. She could easily fly and make friends with the flower, she thought. But...what if she left the branch and, right thereafter, someone came looking for her? To tell her that it was her turn? What if she missed her turn because she went to see the flower? Michi thought, and kept thinking. After a lot of debate in her head, Michi decided to give it a shot. After all, loneliness was quite boring.</p>
		<p>She flapped her wings, and reached the flower. It was beautiful. Marvellous really. With all those dazzling colours and velvety petals! She smiled at the flower, and the flower smiled back. It was a warm and loving smile. The flower's name was Meraki. They got talking. Meraki said, looking at all those birds in the garden, she also wanted to fly. But she couldn't and that made her sad. Later she discovered a secret &mdash; that she owned a magic pot of gold and it was called honey. If she kept giving this sweet magic potion to others, creatures with wings kept coming to her. She didn't have to go see the world. She could easily get the world to visit her! Michi was thrilled to hear Meraki's story. With a surge of affection, Michi hugged Meraki, and.....lo andbehold! Meraki's colours rubbed on to Michi's wings!</p>
		<p>Michi and Meraki both were amazed. Michi flapped her wings, swirled and twirled. She really wanted to see herself. Meraki shouted to her, "Go see yourself in the lake. Just run, run...the lake is over there." Michi instantly looked in the direction Meraki was pointing to. She didn't think twice. She didn't have to. She flapped her wings, and there she was, at the lake, to see herself. She peeped in the lake. And there! A gorgeous reflection of all her radiant colours. Michi just couldn't believe her eyes. She kept fluttering her wings so she could float in the air, soaking in her brilliant reflection.</p>
		<p>The sky was seeing all this from above. It kept watching Michi in silence.</p>
		<p>"Why do you look surprised?" Michi heard someone say. She looked around, but nobody was to be found.</p>
		<p>"Who wants to know?" Michi asked politely.</p>
		<p>"It's me. The Lake. My name is Styrka."</p>
		<p>"Oh, hello Styrka," she said. "I'm Michi."</p>
		<p>"I know you well, Michi."</p>
		<p>"Oh, then you must know I was as dull as a grey cloud? But see, I hugged Meraki, and got these colours. Don't I look beautiful now?"</p>
		<p>"You always looked beautiful, Michi. You always had these colours. You just didn't know it earlier. That grey was just the dust. Meraki's love scrubbed off the dust, and now you appear in your real colours &mdash; vivacious and vibrant. Don't you know? The grey of a cloud contains the blue of water, the green of leaves, and the countless colours of blooming flowers. All these colours were always inside you."</p>
		<p>Michi looked at Styrka. She was speechless. She kept fluttering her wings without realising it. Styrka, the lake, respected her bout of introspection for a while.</p>
		<p>"Your wings are tiny, Michi, but they are strong." Styrka said softly.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well...I never get to use them much. I have to wait for my turn to fly" Michi answered coming out of her trance.</p>
		<p>"You are not waiting anymore. You are floating at the same spot. If you move forward, you'll be flying. Your wings know their job well, Michi." Styrka was as kind as one can ever be.</p>
		<p>Realising what he was saying, Michi planted a gentle kiss on Styrka's glistening cheeks.</p>
		<p>"What made you so wise?" asked Michi.</p>
		<p>"I don't really know", Styrka said. "I was once a very sad soul. I was sad that I cannot move, and I don't have a colour of my own. But then I realised, I have what others don't &mdash; my reflecting surface. I reflect everything around me...the trees, the creatures, the earth, and the sky...They see their own beauty in me and they become happy with themselves. They become happy with the world. They sit by my side, and share their innermost thoughts. So, umm...maybe, knowing everyone's thoughts makes me wiser."</p>
		<p>Michi smiled. She was thinking of what Styrka had said. "Your wings know their job well." "Your wings know..." "Your wings..."</p>
		<p>Michi didn't want to wait now. She really wanted to see the strength in her wings. She spread them at once and soared high. Up she went with all her might. The wind against her tiny body. Up she went, up, and up. Almost to touch the sky. Up she went, with her eyes closed, air under her wings...And yes! She really touched the sky.</p>
		<p>The sky beamed with happiness, its eyes a little moist with joy. It had waited for long to greet Michi. Taking her in its arms, it quietly whispered, "Come home, my dear Michi. Now that you are here, you are sure to find your song."</p>

        <p>A poem by Shanthi Balasubramanian</p>

<p>We named this magazine <a href="#udaan">Udaan</a>. The inspiration behind this name is the conference mascot, Michi, the bird who broke free of silos and found its true colours. When we discussed this idea with a designer friend, she designed a logo. The soaring braveheart that you see on the masthead of Udaan is a result of that endeavour.</p>

<p>To be the mascot of the <a href = "https://youtu.be/93wO42Y45u4" target = "_blank">STC India annual conference</a>, Michi not only needed a form but also a slogan. So, we ran a slogan contest within the technical-writers community and Radhika Hari's was the winning slogan: Guts and Glory (more about the contest <a href = "http://www.stc-india.org/conferences/2015/content/news/stc-india-annual-conference-theme" target = "_blank">here</a>). Inspired by the slogan, Shanthi Balasubramanian wrote a poem on the theme. <a href = "#poem">Read the poem here</a>.</p>

<p>Udaan was now ready to take shape. To give Michi the wind beneath its wings, we identified authors who could write inspiring articles, and chased them till they said "Yes" and turned in their writings. We then exhorted them to think beyond print and got them to create non-text artifacts.  What you see now is the result of this group effort.</p>

<p>In the spirit of collaboration, the Udaan project is maintained at GitHub. Udaan is open source and free to distribute. Also, because Michi is all about breaking silos, Udaan has an ebook version and an audiocast version. All of these are at the Downloads page.</p>

<p>Udaan uses British English spellings, the Oxford comma, and sentence style capitalisation. Other style matters are resolved through this <a href = "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2003/10/22/1928Styleguide.pdf" target = "_blank">100-year-old guide</a>.</p>

<p>The intention was that Udaan be an interactive magazine that talks of weighty techcomm matters in a conversational, friendly manner. <a class="tweetable" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=.%20@anindita_basu%20@ThomasNibu%20...your%20text%20here...;" target="_blank" title = "Tweet!">Tell us how we did. <img src="https://g.twimg.com/dev/documentation/image/Twitter_logo_blue_16.png" alt="Tweet!" /></a></p>
