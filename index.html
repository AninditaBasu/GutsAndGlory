        <p>A poem by Shanthi Balasubramanian</p>

<p>We named this magazine <a href="#udaan">Udaan</a>. The inspiration behind this name is the conference mascot, Michi, the bird who broke free of silos and found its true colours. When we discussed this idea with a designer friend, she designed a logo. The soaring braveheart that you see on the masthead of Udaan is a result of that endeavour.</p>

<p>To be the mascot of the STC India annual conference, Michi not only needed a form but also a slogan. So, we ran a slogan contest within the technical-writers community and Radhika Hari's was the winning slogan: Guts and Glory (more about the contest <a href = "http://www.stc-india.org/conferences/2015/content/news/stc-india-annual-conference-theme" target = "_blank">here</a>). Inspired by the slogan, Shanthi Balasubramanian wrote a poem on the theme. <a href = "#poem">Read the poem here</a>.</p>

<p>Udaan was now ready to take shape. To give Michi the wind beneath its wings, we identified authors who could write inspiring articles, and chased them till they said "Yes" and turned in their writings. We then exhorted them to think beyond print and got them to create non-text artifacts.  What you see now is the result of this group effort.</p>

<p>In the spirit of collaboration, and because Michi is all about breaking silos, the Udaan project is maintained at GitHub. Udaan is open source and free to distribute (see the Downloads page).</p>

<p>Udaan uses British English spellings, the Oxford comma, and sentence style capitalisation. Other style matters are resolved through this <a href = "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2003/10/22/1928Styleguide.pdf" target = "_blank">100-year-old guide</a>.</p>

<p>The intention was that Udaan be an interactive magazine that talks of weighty techcomm matters in a conversational, friendly manner. <a class="tweetable" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=.@anindita_basu%20@ThomasNibu%20...your%20text%20here...;" target="_blank" title = "Tweet!">Tell us how we did. <img src="https://g.twimg.com/dev/documentation/image/Twitter_logo_blue_16.png" alt="Tweet!" /></a></p>
