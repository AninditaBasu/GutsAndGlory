<p>If I were to ask you where would you like to be in the next 3 to 5 years, what would be your answer? Doc Lead, Doc Manager? Is it because you see these roles as a natural progression after spending several years in the field? Do you feel you have a right to grow into these roles? Or is it because you have consciously invested time in getting the knowledge and skills required for these roles?</p>

<p>More often than not, the honest is that you have not consciously thought much about it, but want to grow to those roles in the next few years. Isn't that how most of us plan our career growth anyway?  However, shaping your career becomes more effective if you understand the skills required in the role that you aspire for. After you acquire those skills, you will be ready to take the next step in your career, not only in your current organisation but outside as well.</p>

<p>This article provides a brief description of the Doc Lead and Doc Manager profiles. I have also included a checklist of activities that these roles need. Use the checklist to assess where you stand in terms of the skills, and create a development plan to work on your identified improvement areas. Ensure that the plan matches your personality type and inherent skills. Most times, people fail in their roles because they try to fit into a role that is against their inherent skills or nature. Remember, however, that most skills can be developed. If you think that you are already doing some of the activities described in the checklists, use the checklists to assess your comfort and confidence level and to check your alignment to a particular role. The success of this exercise depends on an honest assessment.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme-light"><h4>Profile: Doc Lead</h4></header>

<p>A Doc Lead is an individual contributor in the technical track. Doc Leads are in charge of one or multiple programs or product lines and are also the single-point-of-contact for the R&amp;D team and other stakeholders for providing status and responding to other documentation related queries. Doc Leads are engaged in the program from the Requirements Analysis phase in the SDLC cycle, and start laying out the design plans to support respective releases of the program. Doc Leads also mentor junior writers by setting the expectations for content development and also by providing the required training. Doc Leads are also change leaders in an organisation, driving process and technology innovations in the team.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme-light"><h4>Profile: Doc Manager</h4></header>

<p>According to the Dilbert Principle, organisations tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to management roles; they do this to limit the amount of damage these people are capable of doing. Based on this principle, being promoted to a Doc Manager's role (middle management) is the first affirmation of one's incompetency, unless of course, you consciously invest in a mechanism to figure out your limitations and work on them to become effective in this role.</p>

<p>A Doc Manager's role is a rare one in the management track. Not many organisations with TW units have a specific Doc Manager role. For the scope of this article, we will consider Doc Manager as someone who leads a technical documentation team, handles hiring, engages in individual development for teams, conducts yearly performance reviews, and is involved in training and upskilling. Even without a formal Doc Manager's title, most of us in Senior Technical Writer or Doc Lead roles end up doing most of these activities.</p>

<p>However, writing and management are two different functions, mostly unrelated to each other. But a TW can add value in a Doc Manager's role because a TW can understand the context better, relate to their team, and help the team perform better. It is the same equation as of a software developer becoming a better R&amp;D Manager for a software development team than one hired from the FMCG sector. But the similarities end there as a manager's role is all about leading a team to meet its goal and developing the expertise of the team members to excel in their performances.</p>

<p>When we talk of technical writers becoming doc managers, it is actually a transition. In the context of the IT world, the transition is not just an 'Upgrade' (change of software to the next version with more features), it is actually a 'Migration' (change of both software and hardware to the next version with more features). That precisely summarises how technical writers should transition into the DM's role.</p>

<p>As they say, success comes to those who make an effort. And the effort required is to merge performance with potential.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me emphasise the need to know what it takes to be a good TW first and develop your all-around skills, and not just survive in the job. As you may have realised by now, your core skills as a TW will be the foundation for making a successful career as a Doc Lead or a Doc Manager, or any other similar role in the industry. Fulfilling any of these roles will then come naturally to you, and you will enjoy being in the role as much as your team will appreciate having you at the helm of affairs.</p>
