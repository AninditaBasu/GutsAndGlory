<p>
At a time when the technical writing profession is undergoing massive transformation and facing many challenges, the need for strong people leadership is more pronounced than ever. Beyond tools, techniques, and processes, there is that one powerful differentiator that can drastically enhance any departmentâ€™s growth and sustainability - a highly motivated  workforce.  A team that is performing to its full potential, constantly evolving and innovating, every person a strong ambassador of the profession.
</p>

<p>
And who can enable that? That one individual who is rapidly losing hair, prematurely aging, and constantly fighting to disprove countless cartoons where the "pointy-headed" stupid boss <sup><a href = "#fn2" rel = "footnote">2</a></sup> stereotype is endlessly reinforced. <i class="material-icons orange600">&#xE420;</i>
</p>

<p>Given the importance that Engineering has in the IT world, and our status as a cost rather than a revenue-generating department, Technical Writing teams at times tend to underestimate or undervalue what we have to offer. An attitude that colours every interaction we have within the company, and dilutes our influence.  This in turn leads to a vicious circle. We command less respect than we deserve, thereby putting us at more risk than practical realities warrant. </p>

<p>Here is an attempt to share a few thoughts on the subject. It will obviously not cover all contexts, nor have all the answers, but will hopefully result in a sharing of other tips and tricks I can learn from.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>A Sense of Urgency</h4></header>

<p>Comfort kills. The best thing a great manager can do is to push people out of their comfort zones.</p>

<p>Whatever be the reason that brought you into the technical writing profession, now that you are in here, you have to help fight the battle.  No passengers allowed.</p>

<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:50%"><img src = "../images/battleship.jpg"/></div>

<p>Show them how fast the cheese is moving <sup><a href = "#fn3" rel = "footnote">3</a></sup>. Make them aware of what's happening in the industry, in the profession, the major economic forces constantly changing the shape of our future. How the value we bring to the table in a rapidly changing environment is going to decide the entire future of our profession, our jobs, our home loan payments. <i class="material-icons orange600">&#xE420;</i></p>

<p>People mostly tend to underestimate their abilities.  They hesitate to volunteer to do things they have never done before.  Change is not easy, because it brings with it the risk of failure. However, not utilising all our skills to the optimum level is not an option anymore. Sometimes you need to nudge people out of their stagnant safe zones, make them take on challenges, show them how the bar is steadily rising.  Set challenging objectives that help bring out the best in them, support them all the way.</p>

<p>Of course they may hate you in the short term. <i class="material-icons orange600">&#xE420;</i> But in the long term, they see the benefits - additional achievements to list in their appraisals and resumes, increased value in the market, greater respect for themselves, and recognition from others in the company.  Sometimes you have to be "bad" to be good.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>What do <u>you</u> think?</h4></header>

<p>In the knowledge industry, it is disastrous to have people who just follow orders.  Encourage people to think for themselves, provide them a safe environment where they can voice their ideas. Respect their opinions, help them broaden the range of their influence and contribute to the company's progress.</p>

<p>And they can certainly do that. If they can bring up children, take financial decisions, run families, exercise their voting rights, and balance their work and personal lives, they can certainly think of what they can do to improve the quality of their deliverables. <i class="material-icons orange600">&#xE420;</i>  You do not cease to be an adult once you walk into office.</p>

<p>Are we sometimes guilty of "infantilising" our workforce by always providing the answers, and not pushing them to find them themselves first? Do we unconsciously take on a "Parent" role, thereby not allowing the team to grow in decision-making and influencing skills? Is there a cultural factor at play here?</p>

<ul>
<li>Empower people to think, negotiate, and assert themselves in their interactions across the company.</li>
<li>Ask HR for training if needed, to develop your team's assertiveness and influencing skills. Everyone needs these, not just managers.</li>
<li>Send your representatives to meetings; take a back seat at times.</li>
<li>Above all, let people know that it is okay to fail at times, but what you will acknowledge and reward is the speed at which they bounce back.  The most confident people around are the ones who have failed many times, and understood that the journey is about the learning, as <a href = "http://www.judojourneys.com/blog/2015/8/10/to-win-by-losing" target = "_blank">this beautiful post</a> illustrates.</li>
</ul>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>If we are not well-known, whose fault is that?</h4></header>

<p>How well we are known and respected within the organisation also decides how much cooperation we get.  And we are responsible for making that happen.  There are many ways to make your presence felt.</p>

<ul>
<li>Educate your team of the benefits of making ourselves own.  The "Why" always first. </li>
<li>Create a Documentation Team Blog on a central site that everyone sees, if you don't already have one. Post articles, encourage your team to showcase their work, their ideas, share best practices.</li>
<li>If there are newsletters in the company where you can contribute, ask to be included.</li>
<li>Identify forums where you and your team can give presentations.  Delegate, ask your team members to represent the team at times.</li>
<li>Assign ownership to a team member who can ensure that there is a steady stream of posts and presentations from the Documentation team.  A "Social Media Evangelist"?</li>
<li>Help your team balance their workload better so that they can make time for these activities.</li>
<li>Make sure that all these contributions are given sufficient weightage in the team's appraisals. Even better, set these as appraisal objectives.</li>
<li>Be an active participating member of the company's management team, volunteer for leadership and organisation-building activities, make an impact, and be known. It is an undeniable fact that there is a correlation between your visibility in the organisation and how others treat your team.</li>
<li>Offer to help other departments, wherever possible.</li>
</ul>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Manning the pit-stop</h4></header>

<p>I would like to end this with a story from the VP of Support at our company, who described his understanding of his role as a leader, using a racing car analogy.  He tells his team that they are the ones sitting inside the racing cars, the true heroes who are going to decide the team's victory. His job as a leader is to ensure that the pit-stop functions perfectly, like clock-work, in the most efficient manner, so that they can continue the race with the least amount of delay, and maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>He facilitates them to be leaders, every single one of them.   The glory is all theirs and that is their true reward.</p>
