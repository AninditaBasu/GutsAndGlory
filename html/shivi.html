<p>You have attended umpteen sessions that highlighted the importance of innovation and how to go about filing disclosures. Your manager has enlightened your team on the various rewarding aspects of innovation and how it impacts businesses [aha, and your appraisals?] But hold on - are you sure you have got the fundamentals right?</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you, at a personal level, approach the whole notion of innovation?</li>
<li>How do you become a prolific innovator?</li>
<li>What should you do to stay innovative?</li>
<li>When ideas fail you, what can you do to keep yourself motivated?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are one who is seeking answers to these questions, then this article is for you!  This is a simple compilation of facts based on my own personal experiences and some great practical tips that I've received from my colleagues and superiors over the past many months. Read on - you'd be surprised to learn that it is a lot easier to develop that "innovation mindset" than you'd have ever imagined!</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Why innovate at all?</h4></header>

<p>In simple terms, you innovate because it helps you stand out in the crowd. Innovation is key to determining what sets a company apart from its competitors. Innovation is vital to the continued success of a business, no matter how strong and efficient the company's workforce is. Put yourself in user's shoes and answer this question - would you prefer a product that offers innovative features and makes your life easier or one that is stagnant and prone to becoming obsolete fast? On a lighter note, the whole process of innovation could be so much fun, especially when you have truly encouraging people around you - I can vouch for it.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Well, I'm totally blank - where do I start from?</h4></header>

<p>I do acknowledge that innovation is critical in the current market-driven environment, but how do I even get started?</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Look for problems in whatever you do.</h4>No human is perfect, nor so is a technical system or a piece of software. The more problematic the system is, the larger the scope for innovation there is. Start with a problem. For most of us, the user advocates, this step should be fairly easy, because we already possess proven skills to identify user pain points and empathize with them. Just be mindful of the fact that ideas can come from anywhere. If you have isolated an actual problem, your thoughts around it are so strong they will just not let you sleep - and the idea you come up with to solve it could be a potential innovation. Your idea need not necessarily focus on a product, but even on the processes that are used to develop and deliver it.<br/>Listen to this interview with Syed Attaullah, a technical writer with IBM, who explains how one of his innovative process ideas helped reduce time, effort, and costs.<br/>

You might often get more than one idea to solve a problem, and that is a good sign. Nonetheless, make sure not to get over-anxious or feel stressed along the process.

<li><h4>Make it a habit, not a deliberate attempt.</h4>For me, this is the most important tenet of innovation. Do not innovate just for the heck of it. Do not innovate because someone told you to. Do not innovate because a colleague did. Innovate because YOU really want to. Make "thinking" part of your daily routine. As you continue to practice the act of thinking, it becomes more of a habit. When thinking becomes a habit, the act of innovation becomes so simple and effortless. In a nutshell, you just got to be alert and have the mindset to look at things a bit differently.

<ul>
<li><h4>Dare to discuss!</h4>OK, you have a new idea - how do you take it forward? Keep refining your idea until you are convinced that there is some "newness" about the idea. Write it down. Dare to discuss it with people - be it your colleagues, friends, or family - no matter how stupid you personally think it sounds at first. It is nonetheless absolutely critical that the people you choose for holding such discussions with are trustworthy. Ensure that they approach your ideas diligently and in a way not to disregard the sincere efforts that have gone in.

</div>
In my personal experience, people who truly want to see you succeed would go to any extent - they offer insightful views into how the idea could further be enhanced so you see some real value in it. Be open to constructive criticism. Even more importantly, learn to ignore any remarks that might cause your basic enthusiasm to diminish, and simply move on.

  </div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><h4>Ideas are failing you? No worries!</h4>It may so happen that you figure out slightly later in the process that the implementation of your idea already exists in some form, but you were not aware of it up until then. That's perfectly fine - consider it a new learning. It could be something that might improve your productivity or completely transform the way you do certain things. Try to squeeze the best out of the learning. Feeling dejected at the drop of ideas-that-you-thought-were-new is not a recipe for innovation. Don't ever give up!

</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, ideating is not a trait that is reserved for elite groups. Every single human has new ideas but not everyone gives them a serious thought. You might find it a bit hard to believe, but innovation does help one keep the mind fresh and energetic. Check that for yourself. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i> The rule for success is very simple - "Acknowledge the ideas, do the research, and get them validated." Oh yeah, and be bold and willing to face failures.</p>
