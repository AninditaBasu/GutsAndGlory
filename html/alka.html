<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Exclusive interview with IBM Master Inventor Jana Jenkins</h4></header>

<p>Jana Jenkins is the Corporate Manager of IBM WW Information Development community. Jana is from our own Technical Communications industry and has been inventing for over a decade. She graciously agreed to answer a few of our questions about innovating and patenting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please tell us a little bit about yourself.<br/>Currently the Corporate Manager of our WW Information Development community. I've been inventing since 2003. Over the past eight years, I have chaired the Interface Technologies Invention Development Team (IDT), which is responsible for reviewing invention disclosures around the topics of UX, translation, widgets, mobile interface, ID, accessibility, input technologies, multimedia, visualizations, and the like. I became recognized as an IBM Master Inventor in 2005.</li>
<li>How did your innovation journey begin?<br/>I asked a colleague about inventing. I did not think I could participate because I wasn't a programmer. He made time to explain the process to me and encouraged me to participate. I woke up the next morning with an idea forming in my head. I put the idea together and my colleague introduced me to an IP attorney and asked him to review my initial writeup since I was just getting started. He suggested that it was really three separate inventions and my first three patents came from that review.</li>
<li>Please tell us something about your patents. Were they all related to the Technical Communication domain?<br/>No, they range from security, to content, to UI interactions and so on.</li>
<li>What was your first patent about?<br/>A system that analyzed messages.</li>
<li>How do you get ideas?<br/>From everyday problems, talking to colleagues, client problems, watching TED videos and reading other inspiring information.</li>
<li>Is there a process that you follow?<br/>Not really a process, more of a heightened awareness when I think something is a problem, or I hear others mention problems they are having. Then I try to think of a solution.</li>
<li>Do you have a fixed team of people you work with?<br/>I have several brainstorming teams that meet regularly to discuss ideas or problems. It's always fun to work with new folks, and I'm always willing to bounce around ideas with anyone who is interested.</li>
<li>Any patenting disappointments that you'd like to share with us?<br/>Not really, I guess the biggest disappointment is when you think you've come up with something novel and you find it isn't. But then you try to see if you can add to the existing art or move on to another idea</li>
<li>Which part of the patenting process is most challenging?<br/>Probably just waiting for the attorney to come back with a final "File" decision.</li>
<li>Do you think Innovation = Patents?<br/>Innovation is a change, a breakthrough, an alteration. Sometimes, from a technical perspective these changes are new to the world and then they can result in patents.</li>
<li>What should an organization do to encourage innovation through patenting?<br/>Encourage brainstorming teams (3-4 people), schedule a Master Inventor or someone really familiar with the process to present and answer questions and encourage participation. Recognize participation in the process as well as a successful patent filing.</li>
<li>What is the value of being an inventor?<br/>You are more aware of opportunities for change. It allows you to express creative freedom in your day. Your name is associated with a new and novel creation forever. It helps your career to be recognized as contributing to the company's IP portfolio. You broaden your network with other creative people.</li>
<li>Does being a Master Inventor help you in your day-to-day job?<br/>It can help you connect with other inventors and creative people to solve problems in your respective area of business</li>
<li>Which is your favorite filed patent?<br/>Patent: US8375459 Frequency Based Age Determination
<ul>
<li>Based on human ability to hear audio frequencies</li>
<li>As you age, this ability diminishes at higher  frequencies</li>
<li>Use a combination of audio tones to identify a personâ€™s age range</li>
<li>Use as an age verification system to  help control access to age dependent information and services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can one be an inventor?<br/>Just start brainstorming and looking for problems to solve. Team up with other inventors that have been through the process so you can learn from them.</li>
<li>What are the key things that you will like to tell the enthusiasts who want to try their hand at filing a patent?<br/>Don't be afraid to begin and don't be overly critical of what you come up with. Frequently, new inventors have a tendency to say "this can't be new, somebody must have already thought of it."</li>
<li>What if the organization does not support or have a system in place for patent filing?<br/>If innovation is important to your company, it might be helpful to speak with management, executives, or someone in the IP Law department about the benefits of innovation and inventing. Holding patents protects your company's freedom of use and can provide a new source of licensing income if your patents are important to your industry.You can suggest a pilot where an Invention Development Team works with IP Law and reviews the ideas or invention disclosures that get submitted. Set some goals, provide incentives, and see what comes of it. Be willing to lead the effort.</li>
<li>What is your "mantra" that keeps you going?<br/>I'm not sure I have a mantra - I'm just always ready to think and talk about the next great idea.</li>
<li>Any quick tips for us?<br/>Get going, be creative, search for prior art, believe in your idea, and have fun!</li>
</ul>
