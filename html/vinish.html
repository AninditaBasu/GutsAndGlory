<p>A DITA specialist. Certified UA Engineer. Documentation Manager. Your introduction in a professional community.</p>

<p>But who are you? Let's listen to this audio clip:</p>

<div class="w3-card-4" style="width:25%">
<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221401246&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
</div>

<p>How can we tell whether the clips are from a movie by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, or RK Films, or by Karan Johar? Because they are a unique brand. A signature. A characteristic flavour. Like the smell of chlorine. Like red wine. Like Dravid's defense.</p>

<p>Your brand is not only what you do because you have to do whether for joy, money, or people. Your brand is hidden behind everything else that you do. A tweet. A movie review. A blog post. A role in community.</p>

<p>You participate in a conference. The chair that you occupy in a room is too small for what you actually can do. Start working on your brand. You are already known as 'something', either for the way you write emails, or the way you conduct meetings, or for your response to deadlines or challenges. Add clarity and tone to that 'something'. <b>You are your story; you are part of the script. Give it a voice.</b></p>

<p>To those of you who watch or listen to TEDTalks, do you feel inspired? If yes, what stops you? If you want to contact John or Karlijn to learn about DITA1.3, why not do it? Look at how MasterChef India participants give it a shot. As the show progresses, a few of them develop their own brand, a signature about the dishes they make, about their approach to work. If you are excited about something, what stops you? Your manager? Your spouse? Your credit card limit? A broken arm?</p>

<p>Or, a difference in opinion?</p>

<p>Think about those films that are widely liked in this country: Lagaan, Sholay, 3 Idiots, Chak De, Rang De Basanti. We see the finished product and applaud it. There is often some background. A few manageable creative differences. The original star cast might have changed. Different priorities. My way. Oranges and not apples. Chinese please. And not that blue jacket. Still, it is teamwork that unfolds on the screen and we admire it. The applause. The spirit of working together. For the common good. For shared joy. And at least something for the masses, or classes, or both. The power of team, and community. The quest for film maker's personal brand. It becomes the story.</p>

<p>Taxonomy. Madcap Flare. Acrolinx. CMS. Small steps. Twitter or LinkedIn. Mentorship. An article. Give a chance to yourself to be seen. Own yourself well.</p>

<p>Consider two extreme examples of how it generally develops and flourishes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dig a small pond in the garden of your house, and let rain fill it. Within few days, you will see small insects, a few species of water plants, and a pair of earthworms. That little ecosystem. They all sense an opportunity to live together, facilitating each others' growth and development.</li>
<li>Now think of the information ecosystem as the German train network. Try to visualise it or map it on a paper. You can start with tracks, or fast moving trains, the platform, the connecting bus, the coffee shop, the onboarding, wifi, and comfort. You must note, however, that this engineering masterpiece took decades of planning, strategy, and execution, to reach these standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raise your hand if you know who 'The Content Wrangler' is? Hands down.</p>

<p>Raise your hand again if you know the name of company where Tom Johnson works. Not sure? We all know him because of his blog. His blog is his brand.</p>

<p>They have taken many small steps to build their brand story.</p>

<p>Who cares whatever you are doing now? What will happen to your work in 2 years, or 4 years, or in 8 years from now? Not sure. Why not to make the community know you. Be known. Be the community. We are not merely a DITA specialist or a UI engineer or a documentation engineer. <b>We are a dot in this ecosystem. We are a sub plot in the story. Let's script it better. New bleach. New wine.</b></p>

<p><i>That's it!</i></p>

<p>Help yourself if your mind is still stuck at Who Stops You:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your manager: Make a Case. Make a case when persuasion does not work. While out with guests or friends, how do you agree whether to go to a  South Indian, Chinese, Thai, or Punjabi restaurant?</li>
<li>Your spouse: Make a Case. If you cannot convert, show the results. Don't argue.</li>
<li>Your finances: Start Small. We are living in the Age of Opportunity.</li>
<li>Your health: There is always some toothpaste left in the tube. Think about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now think, who stops you?</p>
