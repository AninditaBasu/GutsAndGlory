<p>It was a crisp and pleasant morning. An experienced candidate sat in front of us. He had impressive credentials and a confident way with the interviewing panel. In the course of the discussion, he mentioned that technical communication is a multidisciplinary field. Concurring with him, I requested him to talk about various skills a technical communicator must have. He rattled off a number of skills. When I suggested research mindset, he blinked.</p>

<p>Did you blink too?</p>

<p>It all depends on what research means to individuals. The simplest definition would be 'systematic investigation', which is usually done by gathering information from various sources to present as a structured communication.</p>

<p>At the next level, research assumes a little deeper meaning - systematic investigation to revise or increase present knowledge. This aspect can be interpreted as 'adding value' - again, a regular activity for technical communicators. For my puzzled candidate as well.</p>

<p>The real test of research mindset lies much outside the standard activity, and becomes apparent only in special cases. Let's take a look at some cases.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<ol>
<li>There is a new tool trending and you want to recommend it to your company.</li>
<li>A colleague suggests that your team uses a specific format of training guide, successfully used by a reputed company.</li>
<li>You are attempting to write a white paper for the first time and you want to know how to proceed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Typically, in such scenarios, technical communicators tend to take help of peer groups and online forums. Let's see how these cases can be researched much more systematically.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>The first step of any research activity is to define the objective clearly. In these specific cases, the objectives will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deduce if ToolX is the right tool for your company projects.</li>
<li>Determine if the suggested format is suitable for your training guide.</li>
<li>Learn to write a white paper.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the objective is established, it needs to be broken down into measurable attributes. For example, some of the important attributes of a new tool will be price, learning curve, and compatibility with the existing system.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>For measuring the attributes, methodology and resources should be carefully decided. The methodology varies from case to case. For ToolX, a trial test may be the most suitable method, and online reviews or forums can provide additional data. For writing a white paper, checking out good samples can be the starting point, supplemented by gathering templates and best practices.</p>

<p>Analysing a new training guide format will need unique metrics combined with a few trials. They may be comparisons on usability, workload estimation for writing and updating, efforts for migrating to the new 
format, and more.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, determining the methodology can be quite a task - especially when the team has no previous experience to fall back on. With technology growing by leaps and bounds, such situations are becoming more common, and online forums serve as a good resource.</p>

<p>With clear measurables in hand, the next phase is collecting and analysing data. This is the most critical part of the research process. Any mistake at this stage can result in wrong conclusion, forcing to do it all over again. Starting with an assumption (hypothesis in research parlance) is a good idea. However, any competent researcher must ensure that the assumption does not influence the data collection and analysis.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>Some of the conclusions can throw you off the track. This is normal. If required, objectives or measurable attributes can be revisited and refined. For example, if you conclude that ToolX may be a great tool but not immediately relevant to your projects, it can still be recommended to the management for future reference. Or, while evaluating ToolX, you may come across some interesting information about online help trends. It may then make sense to refine the objective as - Analyse the online help trends to make online help future-ready for your company projects.</p>

<p>Any research conclusion should withstand the subsequent tests. The practical suggestions based on the conclusions should be implemented with necessary tweaking and fine-tuning.</p>

<p>So did my candidate do any of these things? He did occasionally, at this intermediate research level, but definitely not that systematically.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>Now note that these cases are still limited to immediate relevance to a technical communicator. How about moving beyond that? How about working on the topics that will be useful to a larger group of stakeholders? For example - what percentage of users really read the PDF manual? How can online help be tested for usability? How much cost-saving results from active content reuse across the organisation? To what extent good documentation saves support costs? Should screenshots be included in online help?</p>

<p>The scope of such topics covers analysing statistical data of large samples to deduce quantitative results, which can also be supplemented with some insights from a qualitative research.</p>

<p>These advanced topics need a longer timeframe and also need participation across teams. Some activities like user testing may also necessitate help from an external agency. Finally, you will have to work on gaining support of the senior management with a significant value proposition. Such bigger projects definitely demand a methodical approach. Beginning with the hypothesis in case of saving support costs, the hypothesis itself may require time and efforts for correct definition. A detailed discussion in the team will help you decide on the research methodology.  At times, there may be a couple of parallel studies to arrive at a final conclusion. Brainstorming in these cross-functional teams will expose you to new concepts and innovative techniques - a bonus benefit.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, data collection for such projects will be spread across a longer timeframe, often more than 10 months. Measurables could also be many more and a number of statistical tests might be required to handle the analysis. Ensure that your task list factors in this project, and keep your management regularly updated about the progress.</p>

<p>22% lower support cost, 47% users refer to documentation as a first step to solve a problem, 11% cost-saving by content reuse - result of such research projects are distinct and compelling, mostly due to clear statistics. Ensure that you publish these results internally to have a broader impact across the organisation. If possible, share the conclusions and suggestions with your peers and professional community. It is another opportunity to improve on them.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>STC also undertakes similar activities and some of the path-breaking research in technical communication are funded by STC. Judy Ramey and Janice Redish worked on a yearlong project for <i>Measuring the Value Added By Professional Technical Communicators (1993-994)</i>, to highlight value and not just compliance for technical communication activities.</p>

<p>Expanding the scope further, how about looking at Technical Communication on a larger scale? Quite a few research studies can be found online that focus on tools, processes, and best practices. Several professional bodies like STC, ISTC, and tekom propose and carry out such studies and make them available to the community. Some dedicated community websites, websites of professional companies, and research journals may also provide useful research and analysis. Some of these studies can be used for formulating strategy, while some can be used for improving efficiency.</p>

<p>One of the finer aspects of research is examining where a specific field is headed. This activity requires skilled observation and a keen insight into the current events, along with a refined foresight to spot the trends. Expert observers who have honed their research skills are often able to share their insights and project forecasts.</p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>...</h4></header>

<p>After covering basic, intermediate, and advanced research, you will notice that the entire research process pivots on three essential actions - ask, explore, and analyse. This, in short, is the research mindset.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask - be curious, ask questions, respect intuition, challenge conventions, challenge yourself</li>
<li>Explore - keep learning, try experimenting, continue innovating, recognise opportunity, be creative, be persistent</li>
<li>Analyse - start organising,  stay logical, practice thinking and linking, evaluate outcomes, apply validation</li>
</ul>

<p>Developing research mindset simply means always asking, taking time to explore, and constantly analysing for improvement. Besides adding tremendous value to work, a research mindset gives ample opportunity to learn and innovate, which is an immensely enriching experience.</p>

<p>You must be dying to know if the candidate was selected. Yes, we picked him for he was very much open to learn and that essentially is the key towards internalising the research mindset.</p>
