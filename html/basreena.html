<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>A dialogue</h4></header>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Ms. A: So, what's the status of our language release?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Ms. B: Well, Ms. A, I have captured all the dates and progress in an xls file.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote w3-text-orange">Ms. B projects the excel sheet and Ms. A looks at it closely.</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Ms. B: Any questions Ms. A?</p>
<p class = "w3-padding-tiny w3-blockquote">Ms. A (looking confused): I get most of it but what is Lion? Something new we are experimenting? Like Agile or waterfall development?</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So there, I have set context to what the next 1000 words entail, Ms. A's question, "What is Lion?" My instant response to the question was, "Aah! That's exactly what I had asked!" First let me tell you, it is not Lion, it is L-10(as in ten)-N. It is a numeronym for localization. Now what is localization aka L10N?</p>

<p>My tryst with this L10N was about a year ago. Just when I thought I had mastered all the nuances of technical writing, destiny had other plans for me. One of those boring groggy Monday mornings, when all I could think of was my duvet and the most comfortable bed in the world, I was suddenly jolted to reality when I was cast in a cell with, the then perceived of a little beast, localization.  Forget about the numeronym, even the term localization was alien to me. And thus began my journey.</p>

<p>Like any novice, I began to expand my horizon by reading. Localization in simple words is, to quote from Wikipedia, "The process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region. It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets."</p>

<p>Sounds simple, huh? Now let me toss some jargons at you, Term List, Translation Memory, Query Log, Internationalisation, and so on and so forth. We went into an eternal mode of research, and when my manager thought the clock was ticking rather fast, and that she was losing more hair than usual, with the added problem of them also turning grey, we decided to call a localization expert to take us through the entire process and help us understand what it would take to localize our product. Now, that is a long, extremely long sentence. I suggest you read it without breaks so that you get a hang of the stress that I went through, not when framing that line, but when I was figuring out L10N.</p>

<p>So again, on a boring groggy Monday morning, (it's strange that most life-altering or life-threatening events occur on Mondays!) five of us sat in a meeting room, sipping coffee and hoping that the presentation would be solution to all the problems in our lives. Now our problems ranged from bad coffees to cooks and maids not turning up to aunties who were killing themselves to understanding why most of us were unmarried, to the quarterly review that was due in a week. I think I have not done enough justice to the problems, but am guessing this gives you an idea of what we had dealt with that weekend.</p>

<p>One problem I sure knew was going to be taken care of was that I would get enough information about localization, so that the next time I am bombarded with a question on l10n I would not have to bang my head on the next flat surface I see. Well, the presentation did help me on the head-banging front, and I must also tell you folks, the presenter was one hot stylish lady! Most of us sat ogling at her pixie cut, her fancy attire and, well, her matte-finish lipstick as well! But, that is beside the point.</p>

<p>Long story cut short, my team and I did tie down the beast eventually. Although we are yet to have our first successful language release, I must gloat over the fact that we are almost there! And what do you get from reading this long success story? Well, the learnings of my journey from technical writing to localization, which are as listed here.</p>

<ol>
<li>One golden rule to be followed while creating content, specifically technical content, is CONSISTENCY. Consistency of style, tone, format, everything. To elaborate:
<ul>
<li>Use simple sentences that are clear and comprehensible.</li>
<li>Use phrases such as "It is possible that..." in place of "may" or "might" to avoid ambiguity.</li>
<li>Do not use redundant expressions in sentences. For example, don't say "It is generally accepted that...". Instead, say "It is accepted..."</li>
<li>Use a single word in place of a wordy expression, wherever possible. For example, use "now" in place of "at this point in time"</li>
<li>Do not use the "/" symbol in place of "or". Clearly spell out the choices.</li>
<li>Use the simplest verb forms in sentences. For example, use "use" instead of "utilise".</li>
</ul>
If you maintain clear, concise and consistent content, localization can happen overnight. Overnight is a hyperbole, the implication here is that the process will be 10 times faster. But when you are dealing with legacy content, oh boy! Internationalizing legacy content is a formidable task. So if you are dealing with legacy content, the first crucial task would be to estimate the time required for internationalization. Secondly, prepare a template using the <a href = "http://www.qaielearning.com/KnowledgePapers/Localization_Internationalization_Testing.pdf" target = "_blank">internationalization standards</a>, and then begin the clean-up process to ensure consistency in the content. An accurate estimate of time and people count is very important as the clean-up process in itself can run into months. Most of us deal with multiple projects, which maybe planned or adhoc, and this may hinder the clean-up process. One way of tackling this problem would be to have a close watch, and to constantly scrutinise the progress of the clean-up process.
</li>
<li>All domain specific keywords are identified and maintained by the translator in what is referred to as Translation Memory. You can, at any time, request the custody of this memory, well, at least that is what the contract says. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i> There is also the Term List, which is a list of all the recurring words and phrases in your content. The list also includes a corresponding translation to these words and phrases, which the translator has provided. Before the onset of the translation process, this term list is shared with you so that you can review it, and verify the translations used. Once you verify and validate the term list, the translators kick-start the translation process. So then, what about a language like Aramaic? Good question, when you figure it out, please get in touch with me. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i> For now, we are targeting only the languages of those regions where we have a branch. Doing so has the added benefit of having at least one employee who will know the local language.</li>
<li>When you have your content localization-ready, you may fall under the illusion that all you have to do is send this across to the translator, and the translation process will happen seamlessly. Ha! You are wrong! Send your content to the translator, and there comes to you what they call the Query Log. As the term suggests, this log will have all the possible questions anyone in the world can ask about your content. Questions range from understanding a certain way of writing to some of your instructions which the translator could not understand. To reduce the queries in the Query Log, the best practise is to expose your product to the translators. Give them a basic training on what the product does and how it functions. This briefing helps them to understand the content in context to the product. You can also create a list of translation rules that the translator must adhere to. The translation rules include guidelines on what is to be translated, transliterated, not translated or transliterated, and so on.</li>
<li>The first time, like the wise always say, it is hard. After you get one successful cycle of localization there is no looking back. A typical localization cycle includes:
 <div class="w3-image w3-container">
  <img src="#" alt="diagram" style="width:50%"/>
  <div class="w3-title w3-text-black">.</div>
</div> 
</li>
<li>Never be afraid to venture into something new. Give it your best shot and things will fall in place. What counts is the sincerity with which you move forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was not a cake walk for me or my team. We failed at junctures, could not produce results at some point, but we did not give up. In trying to explore the novelty of localization, to making sure our product was localization-ready, to co-ordinating with software developers and business developers, it was a long tiring journey. But I must say, we have attained satiety. We have cracked it all. To the experts in this field, this may sound banal, but for us as a team, as amateurs, this is an accomplishment.</p>

<p>To quote my favourite poet Rumi, "As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears." And so, that sums up my journey from guts to glory. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i></p>
