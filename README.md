# GutsAndGlory
Publication of the STC India annual conference of 2015 at Pune.

This project has two branches: one called **Master**, which is the default branch, which you should ignore completely, and the second called **gh-pages** which is the branch that populates the files you see published at [http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html](http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html).

Therefore, remember to update the files **ONLY of the gh-pages** branch: [https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages).

## CSS files are in the "css" folder
The CSS files for presentation are sourced as under:
- w3.css, w3-theme-indigo.css, and w3-theme-orange.css are from w3schools.com: [http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). These files contain the basic presentation formatting. The files are free to use.
- flip.css is from [https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial](https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial). I edited the file to remove the colours (colours come from the w3 CSS files) and to increase the size of the boxes. The file is free to use. The file is used for styling the "flip" effect for cards.
- common.css is for styles not contained in the w3 CSS files but which we need. Anindita created this file so no ack needed. Contains the style for line spacing, tweetable sentences, and non-underlined links.

## Javascript files are in the "js" folder
The sorttable.js file is for making tables sortable on column-click. The file is from this website: [http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/). It is free to use.

## Image files are in the "images" folder
The logo (michi), and author mugshots reside here.

## Main page of the magazine is called index.html
