# GutsAndGlory
Publication of the [STC India annual conference of 2015 at Pune](https://youtu.be/93wO42Y45u4).

This project has two branches: one called **Master**, which is the default branch, which you should ignore completely, and the second called **gh-pages** which is the branch that populates the files you see published at [http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html](http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html).

Therefore, remember to update the files **ONLY of the gh-pages** branch: [https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages).

## JSON file
The JSON file is a GitHub-generated file. **Do NOT delete this file**, else the publishing won't work. This file resides in the root folder.

## Main page of the magazine is called index.html
It resides in the root folder. **Do not rename this file**, else the publishing won't work.

## Articles are in the "html" folder
All articles are here except the front page, which is called index.html and resides in the root folder. The article files are named after their authors.

This folder also contains two boilerplate files, header.html and footer.html, for the content that is common for all of the article files. If you download all of the HTML files to a computer, the content-referencing might not work correctly all the time; the referencing works fine when the files are on a server.

## CSS files are in the "css" folder
The CSS files for presentation are sourced as under:
- w3.css, w3-theme-indigo.css, and w3-theme-orange.css are from w3schools.com: [http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). These files contain the basic presentation formatting. The files are free to use, and are used here AS-IS.
- flip.css is from [https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial](https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial). Anindita edited the file to remove the colours (colours come from the w3 CSS files) and to increase the size of the boxes. The file is free to use. The file is used for styling the "flip" effect for cards.
- bubble.css is from [http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/demo/](http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/demo/). The file is free to use. Anindita edited the file to create 4 different colour-bubbles.
-  fnotehovertext.css is for styling the footnotes on mouseover. Anindita created this file, so no acknowledgement needed.
-  tooltip.css is for styling on mouseover on author names in articles. It is from [http://www.menucool.com/tooltip/css-tooltip/](http://www.menucool.com/tooltip/css-tooltip/) and free to use.
- common.css is for styles not contained in the w3 CSS files but which we need. Anindita created this file, so no acknowledgement needed.

## Downloadable stuff is in the "downloads" folder
