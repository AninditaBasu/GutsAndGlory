# GutsAndGlory
Publication of the STC India annual conference of 2015 at Pune.

This project has two branches: one called **Master**, which is the default branch, which you should ignore completely, and the second called **gh-pages** which is the branch that populates the files you see published at [http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html[(http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html).

Therefore, remember to update the files ONLY of the **gh-pages** branch: [https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages).

## CSS files
The CSS files for presentation are sourced as under:
- w3.css, w3-theme-indigo.css, and w3-theme-orange.css are from w3schools.com: [http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). These files contain the basic presentation formatting. The files are free to use.
- flip.css is from [https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial](https://www.developphp.com/video/CSS/Flip-3D-Boxes-and-Cards-Animation-CSS-Tutorial). I edited the file to remove the colours (colours come from the w3 CSS files) and to increase the size of the boxes. The file is free to use. The file is used for styling the "flip" effect for cards. It is used in anagha.html.
- common.css is for styles not contained in the w3 CSS files but which we might need anyway. I created this file.

The "stylesheets" folder contains GitHub stylesheets for the theme I had chosen to publish these files. Since we're not using those stylesheets, the folder can be deleted but am keeping it for now.

## JSON file
The JSON file is a GitHub-generated file. Do NOT delete that file, else the publishing wont work.

## Javascript files
The sorttable.js file is for making tables sortable on column-click. The file is from this website: [http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/). It is free to use. It is used in volunteers.html.
