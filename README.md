# GutsAndGlory
Publication of the STC India annual conference of 2015 at Pune.

This project has two branches: one called **Master**, which is the default branch, which you should ignore completely, and the second called **gh-pages** which is the branch that populates the files you see published at [http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html](http://udaanstc.github.io/GutsAndGlory/index.html).

Therefore, remember to update the files ONLY of the **gh-pages** branch: [https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/UdaanSTC/GutsAndGlory/tree/gh-pages).
