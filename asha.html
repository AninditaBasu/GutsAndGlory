<p>
At a time when the technical writing profession is undergoing massive transformation and facing many challenges, the need for strong people leadership is more pronounced than ever. Beyond tools, techniques, processes, infrastructure, there is that one powerful differentiator that can drastically enhance any departmentâ€™s growth and sustainability - a highly motivated  workforce performing to its full potential, constantly evolving and innovating, every person a strong ambassador for the profession.
</p>

<p>
And who can enable that? That one individual who's rapidly losing hair, prematurely aging, and constantly fighting to disprove countless cartoons where the "pointy-headed" stupid boss <sup>**</sup> stereotype is endlessly reinforced. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i>
</p>

<p>Given the importance that Engineering has in the IT world, and our status as a cost rather than a revenue-generating department, Technical Writing teams at times tend to underestimate/undervalue what we have to offer. An attitude that colours every interaction we have within the company, and dilutes our influence.  Which in turn leads to a vicious circle that results in us commanding less respect than we deserve, thereby putting us at more risk than practical realities warrant.</p>

<p>A few thoughts on the subject, which will not necessarily cover all contexts, but will hopefully provoke discussion, and a sharing of tips and tricks I can learn from. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i></p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>A Sense of Urgency</h4></header>

<p>Comfort kills. The best thing a great manager can do is to push people out of their comfort zones.</p>

<p>Whatever be the reason that brought you into the technical writing profession, now that you are in here, you have to help fight the battle.  No passengers allowed.</p>

<p>Show them how fast the cheese is moving <sup>***</sup>. Make them aware of what's happening in the industry, in the profession, the major economic forces constantly changing the shape of our future. How the value we bring to the table in a rapidly changing environment is going to decide the entire future of our profession, our jobs, our home loan payments. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i></p>

<p>People mostly tend to underestimate their abilities.  They hesitate to volunteer to do things they have never done before.  Not utilizing all your skills to the optimum level is not an option anymore. Sometimes you need to nudge people out of their stagnant safe zones, make them take on challenges, show them how the bar is steadily rising.  Set challenging objectives/goals.</p>

<p>Of course they will hate you in the short term. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i> But in the long term, the high of having additional achievements to list in their appraisals/resumes, the increased respect they feel for themselves, and what they get from others, completely changes the way they look at you.  Sometimes you have to be "bad" to be good. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i></p>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>What do <u>you</u> think?</h4></header>

<p>In the knowledge industry, it is disastrous to have people who just follow orders.  Encourage people to think for themselves, provide them a safe environment where they can voice their ideas. Respect their opinions, help them broaden the range of their influence and contribute to the company's progress.</p>

<p>And they can certainly do that. If they can bring up children, take financial decisions, run families, exercise their voting rights, and balance work/personal life, they can certainly think of what they can do to improve the quality of their deliverables? <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i>  You do not cease to be an adult once you walk into office.</p>

<p>Are we sometimes guilty of "infantilizing" our workforce by always providing the answers, and not pushing them to find them themselves first? Do we unconsciously take on a "Parent" role, thereby not allowing the team to grow in decision-making/influencing skills?</p>

<ul>
<li>Empower people to think, negotiate, and assert themselves in their interactions across the company.</li>
<li>Ask HR for training if needed, to develop your team's assertiveness/influencing skills. Everyone needs these, not just managers.</li>
<li>Send your representatives to meetings; take a back seat at times.</li>
<li>Above all, let people know that it is okay to fail at times, but what you will count and reward is the speed at which they bounce back.  The most confident people around are the ones who have failed many times, and learned along the way.</li>
</ul>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>If we are not well-known, whose fault is that?</h4></header>

<p>How well we are known and respected within the organization also decides how much cooperation we get.  And we are responsible for making that happen.  There are many ways to make your presence felt.</p>

<ul>
<li>Educate your team of the benefits of making ourselves own.  The "Why" always first. <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i></li>
<li>Create a Documentation Team Blog on a central site that everyone sees, if you don't already have one. Post articles, encourage your team to showcase their work, their ideas.</li>
<li>If there are newsletters in the company where you can contribute, ask to be included.</li>
<li>Identify forums where you and your team can give presentations.  Delegate, get your team members to represent the team at times.</li>
<li>Assign ownership to a team member - "Social Media  Evangelist"? - <i class="material-icons">tag_faces</i> - who can ensure that there is a steady stream of posts/presentations from the Documentation team.</li>
<li>Help your team balance their workload better so that they can make time for these activities.</li>
<li>Make sure that all these contributions are given sufficient weightage in the team's appraisals. Even better, set these as appraisal objectives.</li>
<li>Be an active participating member of the company's management team, volunteer for organization-building activities, make an impact.</li>
</ul>

<header  class="w3-container w3-theme"><h4>Manning the Pit-stop</h4></header>

<p>I'd like to end this with a story from the VP of Support at our company, who described his understanding of his role as a leader, using a racing car analogy.  He tells his team that they are the ones sitting inside the racing cars, the true heroes who are going to decide the teamâ€™s victory. His job as a leader is to ensure that the pit-stop functions perfectly, like clock-work, in the most efficient manner, so that they can continue the race with the least amount of delay, and maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>He facilitates them to be leaders, every single one of them.   The glory is all theirs and that is their true reward.</p>
